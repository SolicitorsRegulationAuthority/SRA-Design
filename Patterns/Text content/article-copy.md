# Article copy


## Typography

The default SRA font is Google Open Sans and defaults to sans-serif font when that is not available. 


## Headings

Heading level 1 has a font size of 38px in all viewports. 

Heading level 2 has a font size of 28px in desktop viewport and 25px on mobile viewport.

Heading level 2 has a top border on it to provide visual breaks in the flow of a document. If h2 elements are grouped together closely you can remove the border with a class of 'h2-no-border'. 

Heading level 3 has a font size of 24px in desktop viewport and 23px on mobile viewport.

Heading level 4 has a font size of 20px in all viewports.

Heading level 5 has a font size of 17px in all viewports. 


## Lead paragraph

The first paragraph element can take a class of 'lead' which increases the size to 20px with a line height of 31px.

If inside a parent with '.article' class it also has margin bottom of 30px. 

## Body copy

The text size on the body element is 14px.

The default SRA font size is 16px. This should be expressed on all body text elements. 

## Font styles 

### Strong

Bold elements such as headings use the 'Open sans bold' font instead of applying font-weight. Care must be taken not to combine Open Sans Bold with font-weight as Firefox effectively double-bolds the font. 

### Emphasis

Emphasized text is uses the Open Sans font but with a font style of italic.


## Utilities

To imitate the appearance of a heading level a class of h# can be added to change the style of the text element, e.g. <p class="h2">Normal text</p> will take on the appearance of a level 2 heading. 

Small will reduce the font size to 85% of the containing element.
